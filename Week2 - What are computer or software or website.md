## Week Overview
The aim of this session is to explore the foundational technologies that underlie digital humanities research, at the most basic, fundamental and easy to overlook levels of the ‘technology stack’. The session will introduce students to key technologies and technological concepts including the technology stack, binary digits (bits)/numbers/code, HTML, URL, hardware, middleware, software, operating system, machine language, compiled language, encoding, and scripting.

	- ### Alan Liu, Toward a Diversity Stack
		- How can the digital humanities help support humanities scholarship on diversity both ideologically and technically? This essay abandons the diversity paradigm prevalent in DH—the “big tent”—for a more technically functional one: the “stack.” It proposes that DH can create a “diversity stack” (conceptually like the “Internet protocol stack”) that combines technical and theoretical strategies for advancing scholarship on diversity. From low to high, crucial levels in such a stacked approach include technical methods for dealing with multilingualism, multimedia, unrepresentative corpora, geopolitical and temporal organizations of identity, and the theory of identity.

### Discussion Questions

Underpinning all DH work is the computer and an associated technology stack.  Can you reconstruct at least part of the technology stack underpinning a project or service you know and use?  What biases and limitations do we need to be wary of in this context?  What happens when we hide/simplify some of this complexity for users?  Put another way, why does Stephenson refer to the GUI as being like 'Disneyland'?  How does the operating system stand as an example of what gets hidden, and the real impact it can have on what we can access and use, how tech companies position themselves, how communities arise around technologies?  How can we see this in the development of UNIX, or indeed of the entire concept of a technology stack?

### Disneyland as a Sensorial Interface

Stephenson argues that **Disney and Apple/Microsoft are in the same business**: they are **"short-circuiting laborious, explicit verbal communication with expensively designed interfaces,"** which allows users to **"get the gist without having to strain their minds or endure boredom."** He calls Disney a **"Sensorial Interface,"** as it moves beyond the merely graphical to engage all of the senses.

- Like a GUI, Disney **replaces complex or challenging processes with simplified, mediated experiences.**
- Disney **hides the complexity of its creation** behind a facade of seamless illusion, just as **GUIs obscure the inner workings of the computer.**
- Disney relies heavily on **visual and sensory elements** to convey meaning, **minimizing the role of explicit language,** similar to how **GUIs use icons and metaphors to communicate with users.**
- The end result, Stephenson suggests, is a **"neutered" audience that is "unwilling to make judgments and incapable of taking stands,"** much like the **Eloi** in his analogy, who passively consume the interfaces created for them by the **Morlocks.**

Stephenson suggests that **both Disney and GUIs appeal to a human desire for "mediated experiences"** that are **"easy" and require little effort to understand.** He acknowledges that this preference is **"not necessarily bad,"** as it can provide access to information and experiences that might otherwise be unavailable. However, he cautions that **overreliance on such interfaces can lead to a decline in critical thinking and a passive acceptance of the information presented.**

### McPherson on the Key Design Philosophies of UNIX

According to McPherson, the key design philosophies of UNIX are rooted in **modularity, a concept that privileges the discrete, the local, and the specific.** McPherson argues that UNIX embodies a **"lenticular logic"** that organizes the world into **discrete modules or nodes while suppressing relation and context.**

This logic, she suggests, is evident in several of the core principles that guided the development of UNIX:

- **Modularity:** UNIX is designed to be built from **simple, interchangeable parts that can be easily plugged together and replaced.** This is reflected in the emphasis on **"clean interfaces"** between modules, which allows programmers to focus on individual tasks without needing to understand the inner workings of other parts of the system.
- **Simplicity:** UNIX programmers are encouraged to write **clear, concise code that avoids unnecessary complexity.** This principle is exemplified in the **"Rule of Parsimony,"** which states that large programs should only be written when absolutely necessary.
- **Composition:** UNIX programs are designed to be **easily connected to other programs, creating pipelines of functionality.** This principle is facilitated by the use of **"pipes,"** a technical feature that allows data to flow seamlessly between programs without needing to be stored in the file system.
- **Information Hiding:** UNIX encourages the **encapsulation of code modules, hiding their internal workings from other parts of the system.** This principle, facilitated by the separation of the **kernel** (the core of the operating system) from the **shell** (the user interface), contributes to the system's modularity and allows for greater flexibility and security.
- **Diversity:** UNIX embraces a **"mistrust of the 'one true way',"** encouraging the use of multiple languages and customization options.** This principle is reflected in the availability of multiple shells and the flexibility offered by many UNIX programs.

McPherson argues that this **"lenticular logic"** of UNIX **mirrors broader cultural shifts in the United States during the 1960s, particularly in relation to race and the rise of neoliberalism.** She suggests that the emphasis on **modularity, compartmentalization, and information hiding** in UNIX can be seen as a **response to the challenges posed by the civil rights movement and the growing demand for racial equality.** Just as the concept of **"separate but equal"** sought to maintain racial segregation under a veneer of equality, McPherson argues that the **"lenticular logic"** of UNIX allows for the **management and control of complexity** while **obscuring the underlying power dynamics at play.** She notes, for instance, how the technical features that enable modularity in UNIX, such as **filters and pipes, also serve to enhance data security, a significant concern during the Cold War era.**

McPherson acknowledges the **practical benefits of modularity in software development, such as increased efficiency and flexibility.** However, she cautions against viewing these technical features as neutral or apolitical. She argues that the **"cultural logic of computation"** embodied in UNIX has had a profound impact on our ways of thinking and organizing knowledge, both within and beyond the realm of computer science.

McPherson challenges scholars in the digital humanities and code studies to **engage critically with the historical and political dimensions of computational systems.** She calls for a move beyond **formalist analyses of code** and urges scholars to consider how **computational systems reflect and shape broader cultural forces, including those related to race and power.**

### Simplifying Complexity and Its Consequences

According to Stephenson, hiding or simplifying complexity for users can have both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, it can make technology more accessible and user-friendly, opening up possibilities for a wider audience. On the other hand, it can lead to a decline in critical thinking, a reliance on "mediated experiences," and a passive acceptance of the information presented.

**A Two-Tiered System: Morlocks and Eloi**

Stephenson employs the analogy of the Morlocks and Eloi from H.G. Wells's _The Time Machine_ to illustrate the potential consequences of this trend. He argues that a two-tiered system is emerging, where a technologically savvy minority (the Morlocks) understands how things work, while the majority (the Eloi) passively consumes the simplified interfaces created for them.

**Benefits of Simplification**

- **Accessibility:** By hiding complexity, GUIs and other user-friendly interfaces make technology more accessible to a broader audience who may not have the time, inclination, or expertise to master complex command-line interfaces. This, in turn, can lead to greater innovation and a wider dissemination of knowledge.
- **Convenience:** Simplified interfaces can make technology more convenient and efficient to use. GUIs, for example, allow users to interact with computers using familiar metaphors and visual cues, reducing the cognitive load required to perform tasks.
- **Focus on Core Functionality:** By hiding unnecessary details, simplified interfaces can help users focus on the core functionality of a product or service. For example, a GUI for a car might only display the most essential information, allowing the driver to concentrate on the road.

**Drawbacks of Simplification**

- **Decline in Critical Thinking:** Overreliance on simplified interfaces can lead to a decline in critical thinking skills. When users are not required to understand the underlying complexity of a system, they may be less likely to question the information presented or to consider alternative perspectives.
- **Loss of Control and Flexibility:** Simplified interfaces often limit user control and flexibility. For example, a GUI may only offer a limited set of options, preventing users from performing more advanced or customized tasks that might be possible with a command-line interface.
- **Perpetuation of a "Neutered" Audience:** Simplified interfaces can contribute to the creation of a passive, "neutered" audience that is content to consume pre-packaged experiences without questioning their underlying assumptions.
- **Hidden Power Dynamics:** While simplified interfaces may appear to empower users, they can also obscure the power dynamics at play. The designers of these interfaces make choices about what information to present and how to present it, shaping users' understanding of the world.

**The GUI as a "Magic Mirror"**

Stephenson compares GUIs to "magic mirrors" that create an illusion of simplicity and ease. He argues that, like Disney, companies like Apple and Microsoft are selling an experience, not just a product. The GUI is part of this experience, designed to make users feel comfortable and in control, even as it limits their choices and steers them in certain directions.

**Striking a Balance**

Ultimately, the question of whether to hide or simplify complexity is a matter of balancing competing priorities. While simplified interfaces can make technology more accessible and convenient, it is essential to be aware of the potential drawbacks. Designers and users alike should strive to find a balance that promotes accessibility and ease of use without sacrificing critical thinking, control, or a nuanced understanding of the world.

### Morlocks: A Metaphor for the Technologically Savvy

The term "Morlock" is used metaphorically by Neal Stephenson in his essay "In the Beginning was the Command Line" to describe a specific group of people in the context of the evolution of computer operating systems and their impact on culture. It's crucial to understand that Stephenson is drawing on a fictional concept to make a broader point about real-world trends.

**Origins in H.G. Wells's _The Time Machine_**

The term "Morlock" originates from H.G. Wells's science fiction novel _The Time Machine_. In the novel, Morlocks are a subterranean-dwelling species that evolved from the working class, while the Eloi, their counterparts, represent a carefree, childlike upper class. Stephenson inverts this relationship, suggesting that in the contemporary technological landscape, the Morlocks are a **minority elite who possess a deep understanding of technology**, while the Eloi represent the majority who passively consume the simplified interfaces created for them.

**Characteristics of Morlocks**

Stephenson's Morlocks are characterized by:

- **Technical Proficiency:** They are comfortable with complexity and prefer systems that offer transparency and control, such as the Unix command-line interface.
- **Preference for Direct Control:** They are not content with merely using technology; they want to understand how it works and be able to manipulate it at a fundamental level.
- **Value of Openness and Transparency:** They favor systems that expose their inner workings, allowing for tinkering and customization.
- **A Hacker Ethos:** They share a hacker ethos that emphasizes creativity, problem-solving, and a willingness to challenge conventional approaches.

**Morlocks and the Evolution of Technology**

Stephenson argues that Morlocks have played a crucial role in the development of technologies like Unix, Linux, and BeOS. Their preference for powerful, flexible tools has driven the creation of systems that prioritize functionality and control over ease of use and visual appeal. He contrasts this with the approach of companies like Apple and Microsoft, which he sees as catering to the Eloi by creating simplified interfaces that conceal complexity.

**Implications of the Morlock/Eloi Divide**

Stephenson expresses concern that the growing divide between Morlocks and Eloi could lead to a decline in critical thinking and an increasing reliance on "mediated experiences". He worries that the Eloi, accustomed to simplified interfaces, may become passive consumers of information, unwilling to engage with the complexity of the world around them.

**It's worth noting that McPherson, in her analysis of Unix's design philosophy, echoes some of Stephenson's concerns about the potential consequences of simplifying complexity.** She argues that the emphasis on modularity and information hiding, while practically beneficial, can also obscure the underlying workings of systems and limit user understanding.

**Conclusion**

While "Morlock" is ultimately a metaphorical term, it highlights an important dynamic in contemporary culture: the tension between the desire for simplified, user-friendly interfaces and the need for a deeper understanding of the technologies that shape our lives. Stephenson's use of this term encourages us to consider the potential consequences of this divide and to strive for a balance that promotes both accessibility and critical engagement with the digital world.

### UNIX vs. GUIs: A Morlock's Perspective

Stephenson contrasts UNIX and GUI operating systems along several axes, primarily focusing on the relationship between complexity, user agency, and the underlying philosophies shaping each approach. He portrays UNIX as a system designed for "Morlocks," the technologically adept who prefer direct control and transparency, while characterizing GUIs as catering to "Eloi," the less technical majority seeking ease of use and simplified experiences.

- **Relationship to Complexity:** UNIX, particularly in its command-line interface (CLI) form, embraces complexity and transparency. Its inner workings are exposed, allowing users to understand and manipulate the system at a fundamental level. GUI operating systems, in contrast, conceal complexity behind a layer of visual metaphors and abstractions, shielding users from the technical details. This, Stephenson suggests, reflects a fundamental difference in philosophy: UNIX trusts users with complexity, while GUIs seek to protect them from it.
    
- **User Agency and Control:** Stephenson argues that UNIX empowers users with a high degree of control and flexibility. The CLI provides direct access to the system's functionality, allowing users to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple file management to complex system administration. GUIs, while offering convenience, limit user choices and steer users toward pre-defined actions, potentially leading to a loss of control and a sense of being "neutered."
    
- **Historical and Cultural Context:** Stephenson connects the development of UNIX and GUIs to broader historical and cultural trends. He sees UNIX as a product of the hacker subculture, a community that values openness, transparency, and the ability to tinker. GUIs, he suggests, arose from the commercialization of computing, driven by companies like Apple and Microsoft seeking to make computers accessible to a mass market.
    
- **Metaphors and Abstractions:** Stephenson critiques the use of metaphors in GUIs, arguing that they create an illusion of simplicity that can be misleading and ultimately limiting. The "desktop metaphor," for example, while familiar, fails to capture the true nature of files and directories in a computer system. This reliance on metaphors, he suggests, reflects a broader cultural shift toward "mediated experiences" that prioritize ease and entertainment over depth and understanding.
    
- **The Role of the Command Line:** While acknowledging the benefits of GUIs for certain tasks, Stephenson maintains a strong preference for the CLI. He sees it as a more powerful and flexible tool, offering greater control and transparency. He even configures his Linux system to boot into a command-line interface as a reminder of the underlying reality behind the GUI's "magic mirror."
    
- **Evolution and Cruft:** Stephenson traces the evolution of operating systems, noting the tendency for complexity and "cruft" to accumulate over time. He praises BeOS for its clean, modern design but acknowledges that it, too, will eventually become burdened with legacy code. He criticizes Apple for clinging to its hardware-dependent approach, while crediting Microsoft for its more pragmatic strategy of backward compatibility.
    
- **The Future of Operating Systems:** Stephenson speculates about the future of operating systems, envisioning a scenario where users could "download" entire universes created by a cosmic "hacker-demiurge." This playful thought experiment highlights the potential of computing while also underscoring the importance of user agency and the ability to understand and manipulate the systems we create.
    

**Stephenson's perspective aligns with some of McPherson's observations about the design philosophies of UNIX, particularly the emphasis on modularity, simplicity, and information hiding.** Both authors recognize the practical benefits of these features but caution against their potential to obscure complexity and limit user understanding.

**While Stephenson's analysis is primarily focused on the user experience, McPherson delves deeper into the cultural and political implications of UNIX's design philosophy.** She argues that the "lenticular logic" embodied in UNIX reflects a broader cultural shift toward compartmentalization and information hiding, with significant implications for how we understand and address issues of race and power.

**In sum, Stephenson contrasts UNIX and GUI operating systems as representing two distinct approaches to complexity, control, and user agency.** While he acknowledges the benefits of GUIs for accessibility and ease of use, he ultimately champions the power, flexibility, and transparency offered by the command-line interface. His perspective provides a valuable counterpoint to the prevailing trend toward simplification and mediated experiences, urging users to engage critically with the technology they use and to understand the underlying forces shaping their interactions with the digital world.
