## The Four Core Activities in Digital Humanities

The sources highlight **four core activities** at the heart of Digital Humanities (DH): **curation, analysis, editing, and modeling**. These activities build upon the fundamental digital building blocks of **digitization, classification, description and metadata, organization, and navigation**.

### 1. Curation

**Curation** in DH goes beyond the traditional sense of selecting and organizing materials for exhibitions or archives. The sources emphasize that DH curation leverages the power of digital media to:

- **Create Enhanced Forms of Curation:** DH curation integrates "humanistic values" into digital environments, providing richer and more nuanced presentations of cultural materials than traditional museum or library settings could achieve.
- **Showcase Artifacts within Networks:** DH curation moves beyond presenting artifacts as isolated objects, instead situating them within "complex networks of influence, production, dissemination, and reception, animated by multilayered debates and historical forces".

### 2. Analysis

**Analysis** in DH encompasses both traditional and innovative approaches to examining and interpreting data:

- **Bridging Close and Distant Reading:** DH analysis combines the detailed textual examination of close reading with the computational analysis of large datasets characteristic of distant reading. This integration allows for a more comprehensive understanding of patterns and trends across a body of work, as well as the nuanced interpretation of individual texts.
- **Integrating Visualization:** DH analysis often incorporates visualization techniques to make complex data more accessible and understandable. The sources note that data visualization plays a crucial role in DH scholarship, enabling researchers to present analytical results in a visually compelling and informative manner.

### 3. Editing

DH has breathed new life into **editing**, a traditional pillar of humanistic scholarship. The sources underscore how digital tools and methodologies have:

- **Revitalized Traditional Editing Practices:** DH editing expands the scope of traditional editing practices, enabling the creation of "genetic editions" that incorporate variants, versions, and amendments into a comprehensive and interactive presentation of a text.
- **Extended Editing to New Media Formats:** DH editing moves beyond textual materials, encompassing the analysis and interpretation of audio recordings, video, film, and other media formats.

### 4. Modeling

**Modeling** in DH goes beyond simply creating visual representations of data; it involves shaping the very structure of information and arguments:

- **Shaping Content Models:** DH modeling involves creating "content models," which are information structures designed to express specific assumptions about knowledge. These models determine how information is organized and presented, shaping the user's understanding and interpretation of the data.
- **Engaging with Simulated and Virtual Environments:** DH modeling encompasses the creation of "simulated and virtual environments," such as immersive reconstructions of historical sites or interactive simulations of cultural phenomena. These environments offer new ways to explore and interpret the past, encouraging critical engagement with the assumptions and perspectives embedded in these reconstructions.

The sources emphasize that **design** plays a crucial role in all four of these core activities, shaping the ways in which information is structured, presented, and interacted with. They advocate for a **collaborative approach** that brings together humanists, designers, and technologists to create DH projects that are both intellectually rigorous and visually compelling.
