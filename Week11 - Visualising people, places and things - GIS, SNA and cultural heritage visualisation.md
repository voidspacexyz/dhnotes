## Week Overview
Trying to read in a manner that is not linear or comprehensive may be challenge enough, but then how do we represent the intermediate and output layers of the understanding we thereby develop?  Visualisation is an art in itself, taking many forms, but always bringing together a complex weave of heuristics, data types (from human approximation through to sensor readings), images, statistical analysis into complex systems of signs and meaning, such as Geographic Information Systems or data visualisations from charts and graphs through to relationship maps and word clouds.  How can we know how to read and create them in transparent ways?

**REQUIRED MATERIALS TO PREPARE:**

There is a lot here - take a look at a couple of these links to get a sense of the possibilities ahead of class.  

1. Technologies and examples for spatial approaches: The dominant platform for digital mapping is almost certainly ESRI's ARC GIS (though QGIS provides a good, free, open source alternative), however a longtime limitation on these platforms was their relative inability to represent spatial changes over time.  This gap is addressed by tools like TimeMapper (http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/) and Nodegoat ([https://nodegoat.net/)](https://nodegoat.net/));   Another area where data-driven spatial humanities is progressed is in the development of gazetteers (a geographic index) and related projects like Recogito: [https://recogito.pelagios.org/](https://recogito.pelagios.org/)  For a good overview: [https://www.modernlanguagesopen.org/articles/10.3828/mlo.v0i0.299/](https://www.modernlanguagesopen.org/articles/10.3828/mlo.v0i0.299/).   There are lots of example projects you might look at, such as: The Down Survey (http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/history.html) or Deep Map of West Cork: [http://www.deepmapscork.ie/](http://www.deepmapscork.ie/) .
2. For social networks the sitiation is a little different, as one software programme, Gephi (https://gephi.org/), dominates.  You can see how the affordances of social network analysis are used by projects and infrastructures by looking at projects like: Mapping the Republic of Letters (http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/); DraCor ([https://dracor.org/)](https://dracor.org/)) and of course the card game (?) "Brecht beats Shakespeare": [https://dracor.org/img/merch/Brecht_Beats_Shakespeare_DH2018.png](https://dracor.org/img/merch/Brecht_Beats_Shakespeare_DH2018.png)

### Discussion Questions

What makes for an effective data visualisation?  A trustworthy one? How does the long tradition of mapping align with or challenge the affordances of the digital?  How do the statistics and conventions of social network analysis expose and hide information about connections between people or characters?  How canthese tools be used not just for display, but to develop different understandings of cultural or historical phenomena?
