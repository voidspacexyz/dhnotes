## Week Overview
  
Data mining is essentially a matter of computational processing, which we generally communicate the results of via some form of visualisation.  The kind of visualisation we choose has enormous implications (good and bad) for what we can see and do, and how we understand the process of reading.  A good visualisation can reveal unexpected insights, but a bad one can hide, confuse or mislead.

### Discussion Questions

Can we ever understand text or text corpus via a visualisation as we do by reading?  Is this a positive or negative shift?  How do we choose the best visualisation for our purposes?  To what extent is visualisation always motivated, political, biased?  How can we see visualisations as both a tool to reveal and hide decisions made lower down on the stack (in terms for example of data, models, digitisation...)?

## Critiques of Existing Visualization Methods in the Humanities

Drucker's main criticisms of existing visualization methods in the humanities center around their reliance on realist models of knowledge, which she argues are fundamentally at odds with the interpretative nature of humanistic inquiry. She contends that these methods, borrowed from the natural and social sciences, promote a misleading sense of objectivity and certainty that obscures the constructedness and ambiguity inherent in humanistic data.

Here are some of her key criticisms:

- **Treating Data as Self-Evident**: Drucker argues that existing visualization methods often present data as if it were self-evident and pre-existing, rather than recognizing it as "capta"—taken and constructed through interpretative acts. She criticizes the reliance on standard metrics and conventional graphical forms that create an illusion of objectivity and obscure the decisions and assumptions underlying the data.
- **Ignoring Ambiguity and Uncertainty**: Drucker contends that conventional visualization methods fail to adequately represent the ambiguity and uncertainty inherent in humanistic interpretation. The emphasis on clarity and legibility in standard charts and graphs often comes at the expense of acknowledging the complexities and nuances of the data being presented.
- **Neglecting Subjectivity and Point of View**: Drucker criticizes the assumption of observer-independence that underpins many existing visualization methods. She argues that humanistic interpretation is inherently subjective and shaped by the observer's perspective, experience, and context. Visualization methods should therefore reflect this subjectivity, acknowledging the role of the observer in shaping the information presented.
- **Using Inappropriate Graphical Forms**: Drucker suggests that the graphical forms commonly used in visualization are often ill-suited to representing the complexities of humanistic data and interpretation. For instance, the use of linear timelines and standard maps fails to capture the non-linear, multi-directional, and subjective nature of temporality and spatiality in humanistic documents.
- **Failing to Model Interpretation**: Drucker argues that visualization should go beyond merely displaying data and should also strive to model the act of interpretation itself. She calls for the development of graphical forms that can express the dynamic, performative, and co-dependent relationship between the observer and the object of study, highlighting how meaning is constructed through the process of interpretation.

Drucker sees the uncritical adoption of realist visualization methods as a threat to the authority of humanistic knowledge. She argues that by embracing ambiguity, subjectivity, and the constructedness of data, humanistic visualization can offer a powerful counterpoint to the prevailing emphasis on certainty and objectivity in a culture increasingly dominated by quantitative approaches.

## Representing Ambiguity in Bar Charts

Drucker uses the example of a bar chart comparing the percentage of men and women in various national populations to illustrate how conventional graphical displays can obscure the interpretative nature of data. She suggests that the seemingly simple categories of "nation" and "gender" used in this chart are actually complex and ambiguous concepts that require more nuanced representation.

Here are some ways Drucker proposes to modify bar charts to reflect this ambiguity:

- **Challenge the Binary Representation of Gender**: Instead of depicting gender as a simple binary (male/female), Drucker suggests using visual strategies to represent its complexity. This could involve:
    
    - **Gradients within Bars**: Using a gradient within the bars to indicate the spectrum of gender identities within a given population. For instance, a gradient could represent variations in how "man" is defined across a lifespan or in different cultural contexts.
    - **Overlapping or Intersecting Bars**: Representing gender categories as overlapping or intersecting bars to acknowledge the fluidity and non-binary nature of gender identity.
- **Question the Stability of "National Populations"**: The concept of a "nation" is also presented as a fixed and stable entity in conventional bar charts. Drucker challenges this assumption by pointing out the fluidity of national boundaries and the impact of factors like migration and citizenship patterns. Potential modifications to reflect this ambiguity could include:
    
    - **Permeable Edges**: Using permeable edges for the bars representing national populations to suggest the movement of people across borders.
    - **Dynamic Visualizations**: Incorporating dynamic elements that show the fluctuation of populations over time, reflecting the impact of migration, immigration, and changing demographics.
- **Problematize the Notion of a Fixed "Time Span"**: Drucker notes that even the notion of "at the present time" is not as straightforward as it seems. To acknowledge the temporal dimension of data, she suggests:
    
    - **Animation or Interactive Features**: Incorporating animation or interactive features that allow viewers to explore how the data changes over time.
    - **Layered Representations**: Using layered representations to show how the data might look different depending on the time frame chosen.
- **Qualify Metrics with Point of View**: Drucker advocates for understanding metrics "as a factor of X," where X represents a particular point of view or agenda. In the context of the gender/nation bar chart, this could involve:
    
    - **Visual Cues for Context**: Using visual cues within the chart, such as color variations or labels, to indicate how the data might be influenced by cultural norms, political agendas, or data collection methods.
    - **Multiple Charts with Varying Perspectives**: Presenting multiple charts that depict the same data but with different metrics or visual representations, highlighting how the choice of representation shapes the interpretation.

The ultimate goal of these modifications is to move away from the illusion of objectivity and certainty often conveyed by conventional bar charts. Instead, the aim is to create visualizations that acknowledge the interpretative nature of data and encourage viewers to engage critically with the information being presented.

## A Humanistic Approach to Visualization in DH - Data or Capta - The Durker question

The article argues that we need a **humanistic approach** to visualization in Digital Humanities (DH), shifting away from the realist models of knowledge borrowed from the natural and social sciences. The article proposes that we should conceive of all data as **capta** — "taken" and constructed, rather than given. The article outlines the principles of a humanistic approach to visualization in DH, focusing on three key aspects:

- **Data as Capta**: Recognizing that data are not self-evident but are constructed through acts of interpretation.
- **Qualitative Display**: Emphasizing the expressive quality of interpretation, moving away from standard metrics towards **subjective metrics and graphics** that can embody ambiguity and uncertainty.
- **Graphical Information**: Understanding information as graphically constituted, using visual elements to express the constructed nature of knowledge.

The article argues that the conventional forms of graphical display, such as bar charts and graphs, often present information with a simplicity and legibility that obscures the interpretative framework on which the data were constructed. The article uses the example of a bar chart comparing the percentage of men and women in various national populations to illustrate this point. The article suggests that the chart reifies categories such as national populations, time span, and gender, naturalizing them as discrete and fixed, while ignoring the complexities and ambiguities inherent in these categories.

The article advocates for the creation of graphical expressions that can accommodate ambiguity and uncertainty, moving away from standard, uninflected metrics to metrics that express interpretation. The article suggests that every metric should be understood "as a factor of X," where X is a point of view, agenda, assumption, or convention. This approach shifts the character of information from self-evident "fact" to a constructed interpretation motivated by a human agenda. The article proposes using graphical strategies to represent the interpreted and partial nature of knowledge, such as permeable edges, dotted lines, and points that vary in size and ambiguity of placement .

The article also explores the application of humanistic principles to the graphical display of **temporality** and **spatiality**. It argues that temporality and spatiality should be understood as **functions of interpretation**, influenced by factors such as mood, events, and perspectives. The article suggests that visualization tools should be able to express the non-continuous, non-homogenous, and multi-directional nature of temporality and spatiality in humanities documents .

The article concludes by emphasizing that a humanistic approach to visualization in DH is crucial for representing the interpretative nature of humanistic knowledge and for challenging the dominance of realist models that prioritize certainty and objectivity .

## Reworking Conventional Graphical Displays for Humanistic Interpretation

Drucker proposes a radical reworking of conventional graphical displays to better represent the interpretative nature of humanistic knowledge. Instead of simply incorporating more complex data into existing models, Drucker argues for a fundamental shift in how we conceive of and visualize information, moving away from the assumptions of objectivity and certainty inherent in realist approaches.

- **Challenge the Notion of Data as Given**: The first step in this reworking involves recognizing that all data is capta — taken and constructed through acts of interpretation. Drucker critiques the assumption that data pre-exists its parameterization, arguing that even seemingly simple categories like "nation" or "gender" are already interpreted expressions laden with complexities and ambiguities.
- **Embrace Ambiguity and Uncertainty**: Instead of striving for the clarity and legibility of standard metrics, Drucker proposes embracing ambiguity and uncertainty in graphical displays. She suggests employing graphical strategies like permeable edges, dotted lines, and points with varying sizes and degrees of placement ambiguity to represent the partial and situated nature of interpreted knowledge.
- **Adopt Subjective Metrics and Graphics**: Drucker argues for shifting from standard metrics to **subjective metrics** that express interpretation, understanding every metric "as a factor of X," where X represents a particular point of view, agenda, or assumption. This approach acknowledges the role of the observer in shaping the information being presented.
- **Transform Basic Graphical Elements**: Drucker suggests transforming the basic elements of conventional graphical displays to reflect humanistic principles. For instance, instead of using equal scale divisions and continuous, straight coordinate lines, humanistic graphics might incorporate breaks, repetitions, curves, or dips to reflect the non-linear and dynamic nature of interpretation.
- **Express Temporality and Spatiality as Functions of Interpretation**: Recognizing that time and space are not neutral containers but are shaped by experience and perspective, Drucker proposes representing temporality and spatiality as functions of interpretation. This involves moving away from linear timelines and standard maps towards visualizations that can accommodate multiple points of view, subjective distortions, and the influence of factors like mood, events, and cultural context.
- **Use Graphics to Model Interpretation**: Drucker also suggests using graphics not just to display data but to model the act of interpretation itself. This could involve visualizations that show how meaning is constructed through the interaction of the observer and the object of study, highlighting the dynamic and performative nature of interpretation.

Drucker emphasizes that this reworking of graphical displays is not about idiosyncrasy or solipsism but about developing a systematic approach to visualization that is appropriate to the principles of humanistic inquiry. She argues that such an approach is crucial for challenging the dominance of realist models and for asserting the authority of humanistic knowledge in a culture increasingly dominated by quantitative approaches.

Here are some ways visualization methods can better reflect interpretive knowledge, according to the sources:

- **Recognize that all data are capta.** The word _data_ implies that something is given, while _capta_ recognizes that the information is "taken" and constructed. Humanistic inquiry acknowledges that knowledge production is partial, situated, and constitutive. In other words, knowledge is constructed or "taken," it's not simply given as a representation of a pre-existing fact.
- **Design graphics to express interpreted phenomena.** Interpreted knowledge is situated, observer co-dependent, and partial. Graphics should express the subjective character of the information they depict, perhaps by using variable intensity of tone, size, or color. For example, a visualization could use "skittish points on an unstable grid" to represent anxiety around an event.
- **Use non-standard metrics in graphics.** For instance, scale divisions in a humanistic graphic should not be equal units. The coordinate lines might have breaks, repetitions, and curves. The resulting graphic might not be as "legible" as a standard graph, so it will require more labeling.
- **Represent time as temporality.** Time in humanistic inquiry is often discontinuous, multi-directional, and variable. It is frequently expressed in relational terms (e.g. "before" or "after" a particular event). Graphics should represent time as it is actually experienced by people, not as a continuous, uni-directional, and homogenous phenomenon.
- **Represent space as spatiality.** Just as temporality accounts for the variable experience of time, spatiality accounts for the variable experience of space. For example, one could use a map to trace a journey, and distort the proportions to "reflect hazard, delays, dalliances, terrain changes, interruptions of war and political strife, danger, weather, or illness."

The sources use a few examples to illustrate how these principles could be applied to visualization methods:

- **Gender representation in comics.** A bar chart that compares the percentage of men and women in various nations could be modified to illustrate how the definition of "gender" is socially constructed. For example, one bar could depict gender on a continuum rather than a binary. Or, one could show how the definition of a "nation" is impacted by the movement of people across borders.
- **Novel publication dates.** A chart that shows the number of novels published in a given year could use non-standard metrics to demonstrate how the definition of "published" varies depending on factors like the date of writing, acquisition, editing, and release.
- **The experience of waiting for a bus.** A graphic could depict how three people waiting for a bus experience time differently based on their individual circumstances. For instance, a person who is late for work might experience time moving much faster than a person who has nowhere to be.

The sources argue that **rethinking visualization methods in this way is essential for the future of the digital humanities.** If humanistic knowledge is to be taken seriously, it must be represented in ways that are true to its core principles. Otherwise, "we give the game away in advance, ceding the territory of interpretation to the ruling authority of certainty established on the false claims of observer-independent objectivity in the 'visual display of quantitative information.'"

## The Goals Behind Florence Nightingale's Rose Diagram

The sources explain that Florence Nightingale's Rose Diagram, also called the Coxcomb or Wedges, was created with specific persuasive goals in mind, going beyond simply presenting data about mortality rates.

- **Highlighting Preventable Deaths:** Nightingale wanted to use the diagram to demonstrate that deaths from epidemic diseases were preventable. At the time, England's Chief Medical Officer, John Simon, believed that such deaths were largely unavoidable. Nightingale sought to challenge this view and advocate for sanitation reform, which she believed could significantly reduce mortality rates.
- **Showcasing the Impact of Sanitation:** The diagram effectively contrasted the mortality rates from preventable diseases before and after the implementation of sanitary reforms during the Crimean War.
    - By visually emphasizing the reduction in deaths following these reforms, Nightingale aimed to provide compelling evidence to support her argument for improved sanitation practices.
- **Supporting a "Before and After" Narrative:** Nightingale deliberately designed the diagram to emphasize the difference in mortality rates between the first year of the war, before sanitation improvements, and the second year, after their implementation.
    - This "before and after" narrative was central to her message, and the circular format of the Rose Diagram effectively conveyed this temporal shift.
- **Downplaying Seasonal Variations:** The diagram's use of areas, rather than linear measures, helped to minimize the visual impact of seasonal variations in mortality rates, which could have distracted from the intended message.
    - For instance, the high mortality rate in the first January might have been attributed to "General Winter" rather than poor sanitation, so Nightingale chose a visual form that minimized this potential misinterpretation.
- **Countering Opposition from the Chief Medical Officer:** The Rose Diagram was published in Nightingale's _Contribution to the Sanitary History of the British Army_ (1859), a text intended to counter the arguments of John Simon, who opposed increased spending on sanitation.
    - Nightingale used the diagram to directly challenge Simon's views and advocate for her own public health agenda.

Its visual design choices effectively conveyed Nightingale's message, supporting her argument for sanitation reform and challenging the prevailing views of the medical establishment. This example demonstrates how visualization can be used not only to present data but also to shape a narrative and advocate for change.

## Understanding Text through Visualization: A Complex Relationship

The sources primarily focus on the representation of female characters in superhero comics, particularly through data visualization. They don't directly address the question of whether visualization can replace reading for understanding text or text corpora. However, the example of Florence Nightingale's Rose Diagram from our conversation history offers some insights into this complex issue.

- **Visualizations Can Highlight Specific Aspects of Text:** Just as Nightingale's Rose Diagram emphasized the decrease in mortality rates after sanitation reforms, visualizations of text can highlight specific patterns, themes, or relationships that might not be immediately apparent through reading alone. For example, word clouds can visually represent the most frequent words in a text, while network graphs can illustrate connections between characters or concepts.
    
- **Visualizations Offer a Different Perspective:** The sources highlight that Nightingale chose a circular format for her diagram to emphasize a specific narrative – the "before and after" impact of sanitation. Similarly, visualizations of text can offer a different perspective from reading the text linearly. They can reveal patterns in word usage, sentence structure, or thematic development that might be overlooked during traditional reading.
    
- **Limitations of Visualization:** While visualizations can be powerful tools for exploring text, it's important to recognize their limitations. They cannot capture the full complexity of language, the nuances of meaning, or the emotional impact of a text. Just as Nightingale's Rose Diagram simplified complex data about mortality rates, visualizations of text inevitably involve some degree of simplification and interpretation.
    
- **Visualizations as Complementary Tools:** Rather than viewing visualizations as a replacement for reading, it might be more helpful to consider them as complementary tools that can enhance our understanding of text. They can provide a different entry point into the text, highlight key patterns, and generate new questions for further exploration through reading and analysis.
    
- **The Importance of Critical Interpretation:** It's crucial to remember that visualizations, like any form of representation, are not neutral. They are created with specific purposes and perspectives in mind. Just as Nightingale's diagram was designed to persuade viewers, visualizations of text can be used to emphasize certain aspects of the text while downplaying others. Therefore, it's essential to approach visualizations with a critical eye, considering the choices made in their design and how those choices might shape our understanding of the text.
    

**In conclusion, while visualizations can offer valuable insights into text and text corpora, they are unlikely to fully replace the depth of understanding that comes from careful reading and interpretation. Visualizations are best understood as complementary tools that can enrich our engagement with text, offering new perspectives and prompting further exploration.**

**Whether this shift towards greater use of visualization in text analysis is positive or negative depends largely on how these tools are used. If they are used thoughtfully and critically, visualizations can enhance our understanding of complex texts. However, if they are used uncritically or to manipulate interpretation, they can lead to oversimplification and misrepresentation.**

## Choosing the Right Visualization and Recognizing its Inherent Bias - 

When selecting a visualization for a specific purpose, consider **both the data you want to convey and the message you wish to send**. The sources and our conversation history emphasize how visualizations, while seemingly objective, are often imbued with the creator's intentions and biases.

- **Purpose-Driven Design:** As seen in Florence Nightingale's Rose Diagram, visualization is not merely about presenting data but also about **shaping a narrative**. Nightingale carefully chose the circular format, the arrangement of months, and the use of areas instead of linear measures to highlight the impact of sanitation reforms and downplay other factors like seasonal variations. Her visualization served as a tool for persuasion, strategically crafted to advance her public health agenda.
    
- **Matching Form to Function:** The best visualization depends heavily on your specific goals. If the aim is to showcase the frequency of different categories, a bar chart or pie chart might be suitable. For demonstrating trends over time, a line graph is often effective. To illustrate relationships between variables, scatter plots or heatmaps can be useful.
    
    - However, as Nightingale's case demonstrates, even within these broad categories, **design choices within a visualization can significantly influence the message conveyed**. For instance, using areas instead of heights in a bar chart can downplay extreme values, as seen in the Rose Diagram.
- **Acknowledging the Subjectivity of Visualization:** The sources analyzing comic book character representation primarily utilize bar charts and scatter plots to illustrate gender disparities in superhero powers, team composition, and naming conventions. While these visualizations appear straightforward, they still involve choices about data selection, categorization, and visual presentation. Even seemingly objective data visualizations are shaped by the creator's perspective and the questions they choose to investigate.
    
- **Unveiling Hidden Biases:** The sources highlight how seemingly neutral aspects of visualizations can reflect deeper biases. For instance, the analysis of gendered names in comic books reveals a pattern of using diminutive terms like "girl" or "lad" more frequently for female characters than for male characters. This finding, presented through bar charts, exposes a subtle bias in character naming that perpetuates gender stereotypes.
    
- **Visualizations as Rhetorical Tools:** Visualizations are not neutral representations of reality but rather **rhetorical devices used to persuade and influence**. They involve choices about what to emphasize, what to downplay, and what narrative to construct.
    
    - The sources demonstrating gender disparities in comic books utilize visualization not only to present data but also to **advocate for greater representation and challenge existing power structures**.
- **Critical Engagement with Visualizations:** Given the inherent subjectivity of visualization, it is crucial to engage with them critically. When interpreting a visualization, consider:
    
    - **Who created it and for what purpose?**
    - **What data were selected and how were they categorized?**
    - **What visual choices were made and how do they shape the message?**
    - **What alternative perspectives might be missing?**

**In conclusion, selecting the "best" visualization involves aligning the visual form with your intended purpose and recognizing that no visualization is entirely objective. Visualizations are always motivated, reflecting the creator's perspectives, biases, and goals. By understanding the persuasive power of visualization and engaging with it critically, we can better interpret the messages embedded within these visual representations and avoid being swayed by unintentional or deliberate manipulations.**

## Visualizations: Tools of Transparency and Obscurity

Visualizations can act as double-edged swords, simultaneously **revealing and concealing decisions made in the data processing pipeline**, from the initial data collection to the final visual representation. This duality stems from the inherent subjectivity of visualization, a point repeatedly emphasized in the sources and our previous discussions.

- **Revealing Insights:** Visualizations can effectively **expose patterns and trends hidden within complex datasets**. For example, the bar charts and scatter plots used in the sources to analyze comic book characters effectively highlight gender disparities in superhero powers, team composition, and naming conventions. These visualizations make these imbalances readily apparent, revealing biases that might otherwise go unnoticed.
    
    - Similarly, Florence Nightingale's Rose Diagram, discussed in our conversation, vividly illustrated the decline in mortality rates following sanitation reforms. The visualization's circular format and strategic use of area measurements served to **emphasize the impact of these reforms**, making the improvement readily visible to viewers.
- **Concealing Choices:** While visualizations can illuminate data, they can also **obscure the choices made during data collection, processing, and representation**. These choices, often made "lower down on the stack," can significantly influence the message conveyed by the final visualization.
    
    - **Data Selection and Filtering:** The sources analyzing comic book characters explicitly state that they focus on characters from Marvel and DC, the "big two" publishers. This decision, while justifiable for covering a large portion of the market, inevitably excludes characters from smaller publishers, potentially limiting the scope of the analysis. Similarly, the decision to exclude characters categorized as "other" in the database, while intended to focus on male and female representation, might inadvertently omit non-binary or gender-fluid characters.
        
    - **Categorization and Aggregation:** The way data is categorized and aggregated can significantly impact the patterns revealed by a visualization. For instance, in the comic book analysis, the researchers grouped superpowers into categories like "physical," "mental," and "gadget-based." These categories are not inherently objective; different researchers might choose different classification schemes, leading to different interpretations of the data.
        
    - **Visual Encoding and Design Choices:** As highlighted in our discussion of Nightingale's Rose Diagram, seemingly minor design choices – such as using areas instead of heights, arranging elements circularly instead of linearly, or choosing specific color palettes – can dramatically influence how viewers perceive the data. These choices can emphasize certain aspects while downplaying others, shaping the narrative conveyed by the visualization.
        
- **Motivations and Biases:** The sources consistently underscore that **visualizations are not neutral representations of reality**. They are created with specific purposes and perspectives in mind, reflecting the creator's motivations and biases.
    
    - Nightingale's Rose Diagram, for example, was designed to advocate for sanitation reforms, and her design choices were carefully crafted to support that agenda. Similarly, the visualizations analyzing gender representation in comic books aim to raise awareness of disparities and promote greater inclusivity.
- **Critical Interpretation is Essential:** Recognizing the potential for visualizations to both reveal and conceal requires **approaching them with a critical eye**. When interpreting a visualization, consider:
    
    - **The Source and Purpose:** Who created the visualization and for what purpose? What message are they trying to convey?
    - **Data Choices:** What data were included and excluded? How were the data categorized and aggregated?
    - **Visual Design:** What visual encoding techniques were used? How do the design choices shape the message?
    - **Alternative Perspectives:** Are there other ways to visualize the data that might reveal different insights?

**In essence, visualizations can be powerful tools for both transparency and obfuscation.** They can illuminate hidden patterns and biases within data, but they can also conceal the choices made during data processing and representation. By understanding this duality and engaging with visualizations critically, we can better discern the insights they offer while remaining aware of their potential limitations and inherent subjectivity.
